# hw1: JavaScript and TypeScript Finger Exercises
## Implementation and Testing

### Instructions
- This homework is designed to familiarize you with JavaScript and TypeScript.
- It covers multiple programming concepts, including higher-order functions, asynchrony/promises, closures, recursion,  objects, immutability, static members, arrays, lists, and testing.

### Files Description
- `Problems_js.js` will contain the problems that must be implemented with JavaScript
- `Problems_js.test.js` will contain the test cases of the problems implemented inside  `Problems_js.js`
- `Problems_ts.js` will contain the problems that must be implemented with TypeScript
- `Problems_ts.test.js` will contain the test cases of the problems implemented inside  `Problems_ts.js`
  
- The instructions are located inside those four files. You do not need to look at or edit any other file.
- You must document your code with JSDoc
- Once you are finished, be sure to Submit your homework on Gradescope.
    

### Setup
- Accept the assignment and clone the repo locally
- Verify that node.js is installed correctly on your computer
- You might have to configure your environment further.
- Reach out to the teaching staff as soon as possible if you have a configuration issue  
- Run the following command (in the terminal)
    - Run `npm install` (to install all the required packages)
    - run `npm run lint` (to run eslint). However, we recommend installing the Eslint VS Code plugin; it will flag errors in real-time
    - Run `npm run test` (to run your tests)

### Grading
- Correctness: 60% 
- Testing: 25%
  - Code coverage percentage used to compute testing score (%coco * testing points)
  - 2 points for each failing submitted test up to -10 points
- Style/Linting & Documentation: 15%
    - -1 point for each style error or unauthorized disabled rule
    - -1 point for missing or malformed documentation
    - Maximum style/linting penalty is -10 points
    - Ask on Ed before disabling any ESLint rule
    - This rubric item does not apply to testing files
 
Happy Coding!
