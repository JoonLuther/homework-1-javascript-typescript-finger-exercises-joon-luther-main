problem_js.js:
Problem 2.1:  use commas to describe the inputs for clarity:  “array of co2_record, the names of two countries, and a year”
Problem 6: include transaction() in module.exports for proper testing  
Module.exports need to include function Transaction 
Module.export needs to remove nonexistent functions (i.e arrayToList) not included in the problem set 


problems_test.js.js:
Remove Problem 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 test cases because these problems are not included
Line 5 problems_test.js.js 
Change from: 
const hw2 = require('./hw2');
Change to: 
const hw2 = require('./problems_js.js');
So that the test can run without error. Before it says module ‘hw2’ not found. 

problem_ts.ts:
Use module.exports instead of exporting each function because file doesn’t compile otherwise 
Problem 8: description says 40% of time results in success but 70% results in longer wait time. 40 + 70 does not equal 100. Change 70 to 60. 
Problem 9: maybe we should use `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}?fullText=true` to retrieve a country because  `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}` returns multiple countries with that same common name (for example, country = china returns objects of hongkong and taiwan as well). 

problems_ts.test.ts:
Provide student with testing framework similar to problems_test.js.js (we weren’t given this)
